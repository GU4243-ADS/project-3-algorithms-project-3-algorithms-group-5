### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Collaborative Filtering and Neighborhood Selection
+ Team Number: 5
+ Team Members: Minzi Keem, Yang He, Yujie Hu, Sile Yang, Chuyuan Zhou
+ Project summary: Our group was tasked with considering different similarity weights, and from there to see whether prediction accuracy improves by using different similarity weights than that based on the Pearson correlation. In addition, we had to figure out whether selecting the best "neighbors" for an active user improves prediction accuracy, since there is evidence that selecting a subset improves accuracy.
